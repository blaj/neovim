# My neovim setup

### Introduction

These are my personal neovim settings. I created them for myself after switching from JetBrains products. A lot of the key mappings I took just from this package.

### Main features

### Installation & Usage

Clone this repo to your home nvim directory(for most users, this will mean ~/.config/nvim/lua on \*nix systems and ~/AppData/Local/nvim/lua on Windows).
